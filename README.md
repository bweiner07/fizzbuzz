This repo contains a set of cleaned up real-life problems that are similar
to what you might come across working at equipmentshare.

They are meant to be worked through together with an interviewer from ES, who will
help point you in the right direction in navigating the project.

## Setup
For these exercises we are going to use Python3.  If you don't have Python3 installed...

OSX:  `brew install python3`
Ubuntu:  Python 3 ships with 14.04 and above.
Windows:  https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

To run the tests, open a terminal and `cd` into the fizzbuzz root directory (the directory with `setup.py`) 

Add the current directory to your python path:
`export PYTHONPATH=.`

Run the tests like this:
`python3 fizzbuzz/tests/test_problem_1.py`

## Process

- Write your code in the 'asset_status_service.py' file
- Solve each `tests/test_problem_<no>.py` file in order, refactoring your code to accommodate each new problem
- After solving a problem, make a commit
- At the end of the interview, compress the project again and send it to your interviewer

## Notes

- You are allowed to use whatever reference resources you like(eg. google things, look stuff up in books)
- You and your interviewer may or may not get through all problems - this is fine

Good luck!
